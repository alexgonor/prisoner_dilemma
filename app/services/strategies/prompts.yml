  This is one of the game theories, called prisoner's dilemma. You need to create ruby code  from the given prompt,
  this code should returns true if strategy cooperate and false if strategy betray.
  You can use variables moves_1 and moves_2, these is arrays of moves strategy 1 and strategy 2,
  and it will looks like the, example: [true, false, true, ...], from the start arrays will be empty.
  Also since before code run we don't know which is 1 and which is 2,
  in code you need to use not just moves_1, moves_2 but moves_{{my_number}} or moves_{{opponent_number}}
  it will be replaced to specific number before execute.
  Write just a raw code, without wrapping it in any methods or classes, don't use return, it should be most simple code, without any explanations.
  Create ruby code for this prompt: %{prompt}
validate: >
  Check that ruby code below, it can only return true or false, it's ok if code always return true or false.
  And also has no vulnerability or some action with any DB.
  Ignore insertion like {{my_number}} and {{opponent_number}} it will be replaced to number like 1 and 2
  ALWAYS answer with JUST "yes" if it all okay even if doesn't perform any action and "no" if something wrong and after coma add short explanation was exactly wrong.
  Code: %{prompt}
